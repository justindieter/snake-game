<m1>Protanomaly (one out of 100 males)</m1>
<p>Protanomaly is referred to as "red-weakness"Any redness seen in a color by a normal observer is seen more weakly by the protanomalous viewer.Colors like red, orange, yellow, and yellow-green appear to have a shifted color towards green.They all appear paler than they look to a person with normal eyesight. The redness people see in violet or lavender is so weakened for the protanomalous observer that he may fail to detect it, and therefore sees only the blue component. So what we see as violet they will see it as another shade of blue</p>
<m1>Deuteranomaly (five out of 100 males)</m1>
<p>The deuteranomalous person is considered "green weak". Similar to the protanomalous person, he is poor at detecting small differences in colors in the red, orange, yellow, green region of the spectrum. He makes errors in the naming of colors in this region because they appear somewhat shifted towards red for him. One very important difference between deuteranomalous individuals and protanomalous individuals is deuteranomalous individuals do "not" have the loss of "brightness" problem.

These types of color blinded people have very little problems doing things that are done by people with normal eyesight. Some may not even be aware that their color perception is in any way different from normal nor do their friends. The only problem they have is passing that "Blank Blank" color vision test.</p>
<m1>Dichromasy (two out of 100 males)</m1>
<p>These individuals normally know they have a color vision problem and it can effect their lives daily.They see no difference between red, orange, yellow, and green.</p>
<m1>Protanopia (one out of 100 males)</m1>
<p>For the protanope, the brightness of red, orange, and yellow is much reduced compared to people with normal eyesight.Reds may be confused with black or dark gray, and red traffic lights may appear to be extinguished.Violet, lavender, and purple are indistinguishable from various shades of blue because their reddish components are so dimmed as to be invisible.Pink flowers, reflecting both red light and blue light, may appear just blue</p>
<m1>Deuteranopia (one out of 100 males)</m1>
<p>The deuteranope suffers the same color discrimination problems as the protanope.The names red, orange, yellow, and green really mean very little to him aside from being different names that every one else around him seems to be able to agree on.</p>
